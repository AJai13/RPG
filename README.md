# RPG

This repository currently holds my firts attempt at making a RPG game. 

As it is now, it's unbeatable lol and it's not in its final form, since I'll still be implementing it litle by little.
For now, it only has a simple battle mechanic where you just choose how to attack (magic or not) and have to defeat random monsters.   
 

This project was only made possible thanks to the mentoring of the awesome [@r0x0d](https://github.com/r0x0d)
